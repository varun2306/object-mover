# 🧠 Object Mover: Visual Object Masking in Images

> 🎨 **Visualize & Mask Objects in Images Easily using OpenCV & NumPy**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Welcome to **Object Mover**, a simple yet powerful Colab-based tool that lets you **highlight and visualize specific areas** in images — simulating the initial step of **object relocation** in generative AI workflows.

🛠️ No complex AI training involved — just clever use of **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **matplotlib** to apply red masks over regions of interest (ROI) in your images.

## 🚀 Features

✨ Easy-to-run on **Google Colab**  
🖼️ Works with multiple image formats  
🟥 Apply red masks to custom areas  
🔍 View original vs masked side-by-side  

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. 🔄 Load multiple images
2. 🖊️ Manually define mask areas (bounding box)
3. 🟥 Overlay red masks using NumPy and OpenCV
4. 📊 Display side-by-side comparison using matplotlib

## 📷 Sample Use Case

> 💡 Highlighting regions before moving or editing objects with AI  
> 🎯 Could be extended to smart object extraction, cloning, or scene editing
