ðŸ§  Object Mover: Visual Object Masking in Images

This is a fun little Colab experiment where I built a basic pipeline that lets you highlight and visualize specific areas in an image â€” like the first step you'd take before moving objects using generative AI.

No deep training here â€” just some OpenCV and NumPy logic to mask parts of an image in red using defined coordinates. Later, this kind of setup could be used for object relocation or AI-based scene editing.

ðŸ”§ How it works

Load multiple images
Define mask areas manually (for now)
Overlay a red mask on each image
Show both original and masked images side-by-side

ðŸ›  Tech Used

Python
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
Google Colab
